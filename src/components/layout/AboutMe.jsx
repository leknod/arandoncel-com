        <p className="mb-4">I'm a 33-year-old macro photography enthusiast from Spain. For the past decade, I've been exploring the hidden details of the world through my lens â€” drawn to textures, patterns, and life at a scale most people overlook.</p>
        <p className="mb-4">What started with a spontaneous shot of a grasshopper using a phone quickly turned into an obsession. Over the years, I've evolved from compact cameras to DIY reversed-lens setups, and now shoot with a professional Olympus mirrorless system. My work is all about precision, patience, and revealing the extraordinary in the ordinary.</p>
